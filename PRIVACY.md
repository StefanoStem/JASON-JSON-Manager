# Privacy Policy – JASON (JSON Manager)

**Last updated:** February 2026

## Data Collection

JASON does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or user activity. All JSON snippets and tab data are saved locally in your browser using the browser's built-in storage API (`chrome.storage.local` / `browser.storage.local`) and never leave your device.

## Network Requests

JASON makes no network requests of any kind. The extension operates entirely offline.

## Third-Party Services

JASON does not use any third-party analytics, tracking, advertising, or data-processing services.

## Permissions

- **storage** – Used solely to save your JSON snippets and tab names locally so they persist between browser sessions.
- **sidePanel** (Chrome) / **sidebar** (Firefox) – Used to display the extension's editor interface in the browser sidebar.

## Changes

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted at this URL.

## Contact
